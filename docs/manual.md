## Product Variants

### What are Variants?

Variants allow you to offer the same product in different configurations. For example:
- A cabinet handle in different **sizes** (96MM, 128MM, 160MM)
- With different **finishes** (Matt, Glossy, Black, P-Gold)

### Creating Variants

1. When adding or editing a product, check the box: **"This product has variants"**

2. Click **+ Add Option** to create a variant dimension:
   - **Option Name**: e.g., "Size"
   - **Values**: Enter comma-separated values: `96MM, 128MM, 160MM, 192MM`
   - Click away from the input to see the parsed values

3. Add another option:
   - **Option Name**: e.g., "Finish"
   - **Values**: `Matt, Glossy, Black, P-Gold, P-R.Gold`

4. Click **Generate Variants**
   - The system will create all possible combinations
   - For example: 4 sizes Ã— 5 finishes = 20 variants

5. **Enable and Price Your Variants**:
   - Check the box next to each variant you actually stock
   - Enter the price for each enabled variant
   - Optionally add SKU codes

6. Click **Create Product**

### Example: Cabinet Handle with Variants

**Product Name**: S-106 Cabinet Handle  
**Variant Option 1**: Size â†’ 96MM, 128MM, 160MM  
**Variant Option 2**: Finish â†’ Matt, Glossy, Black, P-Gold  

**Generated Variants** (12 total):
- â˜‘ 96MM - Matt (â‚¹132)
- â˜‘ 96MM - Glossy (â‚¹168)
- â˜‘ 96MM - Black (â‚¹204)
- â˜‘ 96MM - P-Gold (â‚¹240)
- â˜‘ 128MM - Matt (â‚¹168)
- ... and so on

Only the checked variants will appear on your website.

### Tips for Variants

**Only enable variants you actually stock** - Unchecked variants won't show on your website  
**Use consistent naming** - "96MM" not "96 mm" or "96mm"  
**Set accurate prices** - Price for each variant can be different  
**Add SKU codes** - Helps with inventory tracking (optional)

## Custom Fields

### What are Custom Fields?

Custom Fields let you add any additional information to your products beyond the standard fields. This is perfect for:

- **Material** (Steel, Brass, Aluminum)
- **Packing Size** (units per box)
- **Weight**, **Dimensions**, etc.

### Adding Custom Fields

1. When adding or editing a product, scroll to **Custom Fields** section
2. Click **+ Add Custom Field**
3. Enter the field name (e.g., "HSN Code")
4. Enter the field value (e.g., "83024900")
5. Add as many custom fields as you need
6. Click **Create Product** or **Update Product**

### Example Custom Fields

**For Industrial Products:**
- HSN Code: 83024900
- Material: Stainless Steel
- Packing Size: 50
- Weight: 25g

## Images & Media

### Uploading Product Images

**Accepted formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP  
**Maximum size**: 10MB per image  
**Multiple images**: Yes, upload as many as needed

### Best Practices for Product Images

**Use clear, well-lit photos**  
**White or neutral background** works best  
**Multiple angles** - front, side, detail shots  
**Consistent sizing** - similar dimensions for all products  
**Compress images** before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG)  
**Name files clearly** - "s-106-handle-matt.jpg" not "IMG_1234.jpg"  

### Image Optimization Tips

**Recommended image size**: 800x800 to 1200x1200 pixels  
**Keep file size under 500KB** for faster loading  
**Use JPG for photos**, PNG for graphics with transparency
